<h3>Description:</h3>

Clean up and report the job done.

That way you can know when was the last time you did it.

Add a picture to every job to make sure things look just like you wanted them to.

You can also know who did what and who has been lazy on house duties.

No more arguments over housekeeping with clean reports.
